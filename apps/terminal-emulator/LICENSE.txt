TERMINAL EMULATOR - LICENSE NOTICE
==================================

This application uses PySide6 (Qt for Python), which is licensed under the LGPL v3.

APPLICATION CODE LICENSE
------------------------

The application source code (excluding PySide6) is provided under the MIT License:

PYSIDE6 (QT FOR PYTHON) - LGPL v3
----------------------------------

This application uses PySide6, which is licensed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL) version 3.

Key points for LGPL compliance:

1. **Dynamic Linking**: PySide6 is dynamically linked (not statically compiled)
   into the application. This allows the library to be replaced independently.

2. **Library Source**: The complete source code for PySide6 is available at:
   https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside-setup.git/

3. **Modifications**: If you modify PySide6 itself (not the application code),
   those modifications must be released under LGPL.

4. **Commercial Use**: This setup allows the application code to be proprietary
   and sold commercially. The LGPL only applies to PySide6, not your code.

5. **Replacement Rights**: Users have the right to replace the PySide6 library
   with a modified version. PyInstaller's default behavior preserves this right
   by keeping DLLs separate.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
