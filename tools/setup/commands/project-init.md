# Initialize Project Memory

Create a project.md file for tracking project status and changes.

## Steps

1. Check if project.md already exists in the current directory
   - If yes, ask user if they want to overwrite

2. Create project.md with this template:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Project Status

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Current Status

**Current Focus:** [What you're working on]

**Branch:** [current git branch]

## Change Log

[Entries will be added by /checkpoint]

## Active Issues

- [ ] [List any known issues]

## Key Decisions

[Document important architectural or design decisions]

## Next Steps

- [ ] [List upcoming tasks]
```

3. Confirm: "Created project.md - use /checkpoint to update it"
